# Traffic Sign Image Classification

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate deep learning models for traffic sign image classification.The main focus is not only on model performance, but on building a maintainable, modular workflow that demonstrates the tools and best practices taught in the course such as version control, environments, reproducibility or monitoring.

The project will initially use the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](l) dataset. This dataset contains images of 43 different traffic sign classes captured under real-world conditions. Traffic sign recognition is an important task in computer vision, particularly for applications such as driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, and it also provides a well-defined, moderately complex problem that is well suited for learning how to correctly implement and operate a complete machine learning pipeline.

Two possible types of models are planned for this project. First, a custom CNN will be designed and trained from scratch. This model will allow us to explore how convolutional layers learn visual features such as edges, shapes, and symbols that are characteristic of traffic signs, and it gives full control over architecture choices and complexity. On the other hand, training from scratch typically requires more tuning and may need more data or regularization to achieve strong performance.

Second, a pretrained convolutional neural network will be used with transfer learning, where the final layers are adapted to the traffic sign classification task. This approach can significantly reduce training time and often achieves higher accuracy faster, since the backbone has already learned rich generic visual features. However, pretrained models are usually larger and more complex, which can increase resource usage and make deployment more demanding, and they can be less transparent for learning low-level design choices compared to a simpler custom CNN.
